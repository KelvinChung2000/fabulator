# FABulator VS Code Extension - Current Status Analysis

## 🎯 **Project Overview**
Converting JavaFX-based FABulator to VS Code extension using TypeScript, React, and Pixi.js for FPGA fabric visualization and design analysis.

## ✅ **What's Currently Working (85% Infrastructure Complete)**

### **Extension Infrastructure (100% Complete)**
- ✅ VS Code extension setup with proper manifest and commands
- ✅ TypeScript compilation and build system working
- ✅ Webview integration with React + Pixi.js rendering
- ✅ Hot Module Replacement for development workflow
- ✅ Extension packaging and distribution ready
- ✅ Command registration: "FABulator: Open Fabric" and "FABulator: Open Design"

### **Geometry Processing (95% Complete)**
- ✅ Complete CSV parsing for fabric geometry files (`GeometryParser.ts`)
- ✅ Support for all geometry types:
  - Tiles with position and dimensions
  - BELs (Basic Elements) with ports
  - Switch Matrices with routing
  - Ports with I/O direction
  - Wires with path coordinates
- ✅ Low Level of Detail (LOD) wire generation algorithm
- ✅ Type-safe data structures in TypeScript (`geometry.ts`)
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage for parser (26 passing tests)

### **Basic Visualization (85% Complete)**
- ✅ Pixi.js-based fabric rendering engine (`FabricRenderer.ts`)
- ✅ Interactive tile visualization with hash-based color coding
- ✅ Switch matrix and BEL rendering with proper positioning
- ✅ Port visualization with I/O color indication (Green=Input, Red=Output)
- ✅ Wire rendering for connectivity display
- ✅ Automatic fabric centering and scaling
- ✅ Click event handling for all fabric elements
- ✅ Basic loading states and error handling

### **File Processing (70% Complete)**
- ✅ Fabric geometry file loading via VS Code dialogs
- ✅ CSV file validation and error reporting
- ✅ Geometry data conversion for webview communication
- ❌ FASM design file loading (command exists but not implemented)
- ❌ File history and auto-open functionality

## ❌ **Major Missing Features (Critical Gaps)**

### **1. Design File Support (FASM) - 0% Complete**
**Priority: CRITICAL - Core functionality missing**
- ❌ FASM file parsing (bitstream configuration format)
- ❌ User design overlay on fabric visualization
- ❌ Bitstream configuration display
- ❌ Net visualization and routing path display
- ❌ Design statistics and utilization metrics

**Required Files to Create:**
- `src/parsers/FasmParser.ts` - Parse FASM files
- `src/types/design.ts` - Design data structures
- Update `FabricRenderer.ts` - Add design overlay rendering
- Update `extension.ts` - Implement openDesign command

### **2. Information Panels - 15% Complete**
**Priority: HIGH - Essential for usability**
- ❌ WorldView (minimap) component for navigation
- ❌ Netlist viewer with search and filtering
- ❌ HDL code viewer with syntax highlighting
- ❌ Statistics display (resource utilization, timing)
- ❌ Tabbed interface for different information views
- ❌ Element detail panels (tile/BEL/port properties)

**Original Java Features Missing:**
- `WorldView.java` → Need React minimap component
- `NetListView.java` → Need netlist display component
- `ContentInfoView.java` → Need tabbed info panel
- `StatisticView.java` → Need statistics component

### **3. Search and Navigation - 10% Complete**
**Priority: HIGH - Core workflow feature**
- ❌ Element search functionality (tiles, BELs, ports, switch matrices)
- ❌ Regular expression search support
- ❌ Navigation between search results ("Next" button)
- ❌ Element type filtering (ANY, TILE, BEL, PORT, etc.)
- ❌ Search result highlighting and feedback

**Original Java Implementation:**
- `BottomMenu.java` had complete search with regex support
- Search by element type with dropdown selection
- "Next" navigation through results
- Real-time search feedback

### **4. Advanced Interaction - 30% Complete**
**Priority: MEDIUM - User experience enhancement**
- ❌ Zoom controls and level-of-detail management
- ❌ Pan and navigation controls (currently basic)
- ❌ Element selection and highlighting
- ❌ Context menus and detailed information display
- ❌ Keyboard shortcuts for navigation
- ⚠️ Basic click events work but need enhancement

### **5. Performance Optimization - 60% Complete**
**Priority: MEDIUM - Scalability concern**
- ✅ Basic LOD system implemented
- ⚠️ LOD system needs refinement for large fabrics
- ⚠️ Memory management for large geometry files
- ⚠️ Viewport culling for better performance
- ❌ Progressive loading for huge fabrics

## 🔧 **Technical Issues to Address**

### **Test Suite Issues (Multiple Failures)**
```
FAILING TESTS:
- 11 failed tests total
- React component tests failing due to DOM mocking issues
- Canvas/WebGL context mocking problems for Pixi.js
- Node module resolution issues in test environment

SPECIFIC FAILURES:
- FabricViewer tests: "document is not defined"
- FabricRenderer tile click test: "window is not defined" 
- Third-party library test conflicts
```

### **Code Quality Issues**
- ⚠️ Need better error boundaries in React components
- ⚠️ Memory leak prevention in Pixi.js cleanup
- ⚠️ Type safety improvements in some areas
- ⚠️ Better separation of concerns between layers

## 📊 **Success Metrics**

**Short-term (1 month):**
- ✅ FASM files can be loaded and displayed
- ✅ Basic search functionality working
- ✅ Test suite passing (>95% tests)
- ✅ Information panels showing basic data

**Medium-term (3 months):**
- ✅ Full feature parity with Java version
- ✅ Performance acceptable for large fabrics
- ✅ User experience matches or exceeds original
- ✅ Extension ready for distribution

The VS Code extension has excellent infrastructure and basic visualization. The main development focus should be on implementing the missing user interface features that make FABulator a powerful FPGA design tool, starting with FASM support as the highest priority.
